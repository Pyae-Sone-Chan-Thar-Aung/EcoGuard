EcoGuard Demo Project (skeleton)
-------------------------------

This archive contains the Flutter `lib/`, `assets/`, and `pubspec.yaml` for the EcoGuard demo app.

Important:
- To generate the native Android project files, run `flutter create .` in the project root after extracting.
- Then run:
    flutter pub get
    flutter run

Files included:
- lib/: application source code (screens, models, services, providers, widgets)
- assets/: placeholder images
- pubspec.yaml: dependencies

Note: The models include generated *.g.dart files so you don't need build_runner to run the demo.
